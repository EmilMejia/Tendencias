Test Scenarios:
Positive Scenarios

Standard Input

Description: Input string contains a mix of intact ants ("ant") and scattered parts.
Input: "..ant..ant.ant...ant.ant..ant.ant....ant..ant.ant.ant...ant.."
Expected Output: Correct count of surviving and deceased ants.
No Ants

Description: Input string does not contain any "ant" substrings or parts.
Input: "..."
Expected Output: Zero surviving and deceased ants.
Only Surviving Ants

Description: Input string contains only intact ants with no scattered parts.
Input: "antantant"
Expected Output: Correct count of surviving ants, zero deceased ants.
Only Scattered Parts

Description: Input string contains only scattered parts with no intact ants.
Input: "aannnttt"
Expected Output: Zero surviving ants, correct calculation of deceased ants based on the maximum count of any single part.
Mixed Parts Closely

Description: Input string contains scattered parts closely resembling "ant" but not forming the exact substring.
Input: "ananttta"
Expected Output: Correct handling of near-miss patterns and accurate count of deceased ants.
Negative Scenarios

Invalid Characters

Description: Input string contains characters outside the expected range ('a', 'n', 't', '.').
Input: "ant!ant?xx"
Expected Action: Validate input and either reject it, ignore invalid characters, or provide a meaningful error message.
Empty String

Description: Input string is empty.
Input: ""
Expected Action: Handle gracefully by either prompting for valid input or indicating no ants are present.
Extremely Long String

Description: Input string is exceptionally long, testing performance and handling of large inputs.
Input: A very long string repeating "ant" and scattered parts.
Expected Action: Ensure the application can handle large inputs without performance degradation or errors.
Non-string Input Handling

Description: 
Input: Non-string data (e.g., numeric, binary)
Expected Action: Reject non-string inputs with an appropriate error message.
